\title{Multiplicity filtering: Removes peaks which occur only once in a n-spectra set.}
\usage{
filterPeaksMultiplicity(w, recalcBest = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{w}{a `msmsWorkspace` object where formulas have been assigned to peaks}

\item{recalcBest}{Whether the best formula for each peak should be re-determined.
This is necessary for results from the ordinary \code{\link{analyzeMsMs}}
analysis which allows multiple potential formulas per peak - the old best match
could potentially have been dropped because of multiplicity filtering. For results
from \code{\link{reanalyzeFailpeak}} this is not necessary, since only one potential
formula is assigned in this case.}
}
\value{
The peak table is returned, enriched with columns:
			\itemize{
				\item{\code{formulaMultiplicity}}{The # of occurrences of this formula
					in the spectra of its compounds.}
			}
}
\description{
For every compound, every peak (with annotated formula) is compared 
across all spectra. Peaks whose formula occurs only once for all collision energies
/ spectra types, are discarded. This eliminates "stochastic formula hits" of pure
electronic noise peaks efficiently from the spectra. Note that in the author's 
experimental setup two spectra were recorded at every collision energy,
and therefore every peak-formula should appear
at least twice if it is real, even if it is by chance a fragment which appears
on only one collision energy setting. The function was not tested in a different
setup. Therefore, use with a bit of caution.
