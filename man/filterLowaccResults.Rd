\title{Filter peaks with low accuracy}
\usage{
filterLowaccResults(peaks, mode="fine", filterSettings  = getOption("RMassBank")$filterSettings)
}
\arguments{
\item{peaks}{A data frame with at least the columns \code{mzFound} and
\code{dppm}.}

\item{mode}{\code{coarse} or \code{fine}, see below.}

\item{filterSettings}{Settings for filtering. For details, see documentation of
\code{\link{analyzeMsMs}}}
}
\value{
A \code{list(TRUE = goodPeakDataframe, FALSE = badPeakDataframe)} is
returned: A data frame with all peaks which are "good" is in
\code{return[["TRUE"]]}.
}
\description{
Filters a peak table (with annotated formulas) for accuracy. Low-accuracy
peaks are removed.
}
\details{
In the \code{coarse} mode, mass tolerance is set to 10 ppm (above m/z 120)
and 15 ppm (below m/z 120). This is useful for formula assignment before
recalibration, where a wide window is desirable to accomodate the high mass
deviations at low m/z values, so we get a nice recalibration curve.

In the \code{fine} run, the mass tolerance is set to 5 ppm over the whole
mass range. This should be applied after recalibration.
