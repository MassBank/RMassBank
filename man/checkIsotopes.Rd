\usage{
checkIsotopes(w, mode = "pH", intensity_cutoff = 0,
  intensity_precision = "none", conflict = "strict", isolationWindow = 2,
  evalMode = "complete", plotSpectrum = TRUE,
  settings = getOption("RMassBank"))
}
\arguments{
\item{w}{A \code{msmsWorkspace} to work with.}

\item{mode}{\code{"pH", "pNa", "pM", "pNH4", "mH", "mM", "mFA"} for different ions 
([M+H]+, [M+Na]+, [M]+, [M+NH4]+, [M-H]-, [M]-, [M+FA]-).}

\item{intensity_cutoff}{The cutoff (as an absolute intensity value) under which isotopic peaks shouldn't be checked for or accepted as valid.
Please note: The cutoff is not hard in the sense that it interacts with the intensity_precision parameter.}

\item{intensity_precision}{The difference that is accepted between the calculated and observed intensity of a possible isotopic peak. Further details down below.}

\item{conflict}{Either "isotopic"(Peak formulas are always chosen if they fit the requirements for an isotopic peak)
or "strict"(Peaks are only marked as isotopic when there hasn't been a formula assigned before.)}

\item{isolationWindow}{Half of the width of the isolation window in Da}

\item{evalMode}{Currently no function yet, but planned. Currently must be "complete"}

\item{plotSpectrum}{A boolean specifiying whether the spectrumshould be plotted}

\item{settings}{Options to be used for processing. Defaults to the options loaded via
\code{\link{loadRmbSettings}} et al. Refer to there for specific settings.}

text describing parameter inputs in more detail.
\itemize{
 \item{\code{intensity_precision}}{This parameter determines how strict the intensity values should adhere to the calculated intensity in relation to the parent peak.
 Options for this parameter are \code{"none"}, where the intensity is irrelevant, \code{"low"}, which has an error margin of 70\% and \code{"high"}, where the error margin 
 is set to 35\%. The recommended setting is \code{"low"}, but can be changed to adjust to the intensity precision of the mass spectrometer.}
