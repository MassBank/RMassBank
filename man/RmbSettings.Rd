\title{RMassBank settings}
\description{
Describes all settings for the RMassBank settings file.
}
\details{
\itemize{
		\item{\code{deprofile}}{
  	Whether and how to deprofile input raw files. Leave the 
			setting empty if your raw files are already in "centroid" mode. If your
			input files are in profile mode, you have the choice between algorithms
			\code{\link{deprofile}.spline, deprofile.fwhm, deprofile.localMax}; refer to
			the individual manpages for more information.}
		\item{\code{rtMargin, rtShift}}{
  	The allowed retention time deviation relative to the
			values specified in your compound list (see \code{\link{loadList}}), and the systematic
			shift (due to the use of, e.g., pre-columns or other special equipment.}
		\item{\code{babeldir}}{
			Directory to OpenBabel. Required for creating molfiles for MassBank export.
			If no OpenBabel directory is given, RMassBank will attempt to use the CACTUS webservice
			for SDF generation. It is strongly advised to install OpenBabel; the CACTUS structures
			have explicit hydrogen atoms.
		The path should point to the directory where babel.exe (or the Linux "babel" equivalent) lies.
			}
		\item{\code{use_version}}{
  	Which MassBank record format to use; version 2 is strongly advised,
			version 1 is considered outdated and should be used only if for some reason you are running
			old servers and an upgrade is not feasible.}
		\item{\code{use_rean_peaks}}{
  	Whether to include peaks from reanalysis (see 
			\code{\link{reanalyzeFailpeaks}}) in the MassBank records. Boolean, TRUE or FALSE.
			}
		\item{\code{annotations}}{
			A list of constant annotations to use in the MassBank records. The entries
			\code{authors, copyright, license, instrument, instrument_type, compound_class}
			correspond to the MassBank entries \code{AUTHORS, COPYRIGHT, PUBLICATION, LICENSE, AC$INSTRUMENT,
			AC$INSTRUMENT_TYPE, CH$COMPOUND_CLASS}. The entry \code{confidence_comment} is added as
			\code{COMMENT: CONFIDENCE} entry.

The entry \code{internal_id_fieldname} is used to name
			the MassBank entry which will keep a reference to the internal compound ID used in 
			the workflow: for \code{internal_id_fieldname = MYID} and e.g. compound 1234, an 
			entry will be added	to the MassBank record with 
			\code{COMMENT: MYID 1234}. The internal fieldname should not be left empty!
			
			The entries \code{lc_gradient, lc_flow, lc_solvent_a, lc_solvent_b, lc_column} correspond
			to the MassBank entries \code{AC$CHROMATOGRAPHY: FLOW_GRADIENT, FLOW_RATE, 
			SOLVENT A, SOLVENT B, COLUMN_NAME}.

\code{ms_type, ionization} correspond to \code{AC$MASS_SPECTROMETRY: MS_TYPE, IONIZATION}.

\code{entry_prefix} is the two-letter prefix used when building MassBank accession codes.

Entries under \code{ms_dataprocessing} are added as \code{MS$DATA_PROCESSING:} entries,
			in addition to the default \code{WHOLE: RMassBank}.   
			}
  	\item{\code{annotator}}{
    For advanced users: option to select your own custom annotator. 
    Check \code{\link{annotator.default}} and the source code for details.}
		\item{\code{spectraList}}{
  	This setting describes the experimental annotations for the single
			data-dependent scans. For every data-dependent scan event, a \code{spectraList} entry with
			\code{mode, ces, ce, res} denoting collision mode, collision energy in short and verbose 
			notation, and FT resolution.}
		\item{\code{accessionNumberShifts}}{
  	This denotes the starting points for accession numbers
			for different ion types. For example, \code{pH: 0, mH: 50} means that [M+H]+ spectra will
			start at \code{XX123401} (\code{XX} being the \code{entry_prefix} and \code{1234} the compound
			id) and [M-H]- will start at \code{XX123451}.}
		\item{\code{electronicNoise, electronicNoiseWidth}}{
  	Known electronic noise peaks and the window
			to be used by \code{\link{cleanElnoise}}}
		\item{\code{recalibrateBy}}{
  	\code{dppm} or \code{dmz} to recalibrate either by delta ppm or by
			delta mz.}
		\item{\code{recalibrateMS1}}{
  	\code{common} or \code{separate} to recalibrate MS1 data points together
			or separately from MS2 data points.}
		\item{\code{recalibrator: MS1, MS2}}{
  	The functions to use for recalibration of MS1 and MS2 data points.
			Note that the \code{MS1} setting is only meaningful if \code{recalibrateMS1: separate}, otherwise
			the \code{MS2} setting is used for a common recalibration curve. See \code{\link{recalibrate.loess}}
			for details.}
  	\item{\code{multiplicityFilter}}{
    Define the multiplicity filtering level. Default is 2, a value of 1 
    is off (no filtering) and >2 is harsher filtering.}
    \item{\code{titleFormat}}{
    The title of MassBank records is a mini-summary
    of the record, for example "Dinotefuran; LC-ESI-QFT; MS2; CE: 35%; R=35000; [M+H]+". 
    By default, the first compound name \code{CH$NAME}, instrument type 
    \code{AC$INSTRUMENT_TYPE}, MS/MS type \code{AC$MASS_SPECTROMETRY: MS_TYPE}, 
    collision energy \code{RECORD_TITLE_CE}, resolution \code{AC$MASS_SPECTROMETRY: RESOLUTION}
    and precursor \code{MS$FOCUSED_ION: PRECURSOR_TYPE} are used. If alternative 
    information is relevant to differentiate acquired spectra, the title should be adjusted.
    For example, many TOFs do not have a resolution setting. 
    See MassBank documentation for more.}
  	\item{\code{filterSettings}}{
			A list of settings that affect the MS/MS processing. The entries
			\code{ppmHighMass, ppmLowMass, massRangeDivision} set values for 
  		pre-processing, prior to recalibration. \code{ppmHighMass} defines the 
    	ppm error for the high mass range (default 10 ppm for Orbitraps), 
      \code{ppmLowMass} is the error for the low mass range (default 15 ppm 
      for Orbitraps) and \code{massRangeDivision} is the m/z value defining 
      the split between the high and low mass range (default m/z = 120).

The entry \code{ppmFine} defines the ppm cut-off post recalibration. 
  		The default value of 5 ppm is recommended for Orbitraps. For other 
    	instruments this can be interpreted from the recalibration plot.
     All ppm limits are one-sided (e.g. this includes values to +5 ppm or -5 ppm 
     deviation from the exact mass).
			
			The entries \code{prelimCut, prelimCutRatio} define the intensity cut-off and 
  		cut-off ratio (in % of the most intense peak) for pre-processing. This affects 
    	the peak selection for the recalibration only. Careful: the default value 
      1e4 for Orbitrap LTQ positive mode could remove all peaks for TOF data 
      and will remove too many peaks for Orbitrap LTQ negative mode spectra!

The entry \code{specOKLimit} defines the intensity limit to include MS/MS spectra.
  		MS/MS spectra must have at least one peak above this limit to proceed through 
    	the workflow.

\code{dbeMinLimit} defines the minimum allowable ring and double bond equivalents (DBE) 
  		allowed for assigned formulas. This assumes maximum valuences for elements with 
    	multiple valence states. The default is -0.5 (accounting for fragments being ions).

The entries \code{satelliteMzLimit, satelliteIntLimit} define the cut-off m/z and 
  		intensity values for satellite peak removal (an artefact of Fourier Transform 
    	processing). All peaks within the m/z limit (default 0.5) and intensity ratio 
      (default 0.05 or 5 %) of the respective peak will be removed. Applicable to 
      Fourier Transform instruments only (e.g. Orbitrap).   
			}  
    \item{\code{filterSettings}}{
			Parameters for adjusting the raw data retrieval. 
  		The entry \code{ppmFine} defines the ppm error to look for the precursor in 
    	the MS1 (parent) spectrum. Default is 10 ppm for Orbitrap.

\code{mzCoarse} defines the error to search for the precursor specification 
  		in the MS2 spectrum. This is often only saved to 2 decimal places and thus 
    	can be quite inaccurate. The accuracy also depends on the isolation window used. 
      The default settings (for e.g. Orbitrap) is 0.5 (Da, or Th for m/z).

The entry \code{fillPrecursorScan} is largely untested. The default value 
  		(FALSE) assumes all necessary precursor information is available in the mzML file.
    	A setting ot TRUE tries to fill in the precursor data scan number if it is missing.
      Only tested on one case study so far - feedback welcome!
