\title{Filter satellite peaks}
\usage{
filterPeakSatellites(peaks, filterSettings = getOption("RMassBank")$filterSettings)
}
\arguments{
\item{peaks}{A peak dataframe with at least the columns \code{mz, int}. Note
that \code{mz} is used even for the recalibrated spectra, i.e. the
desatellited spectrum is identical for both the unrecalibrated and the
recalibrated spectra.}

\item{filterSettings}{The settings used for filtering. Refer to \code{\link{analyzeMsMs}}
documentation for filter settings.}
}
\value{
Returns the peak table with satellite peaks removed.
}
\description{
Filters satellite peaks in FT spectra which arise from FT artifacts and from
conversion to stick mode. A very simple rule is used which holds mostly true
for MSMS spectra (and shouldn't be applied to MS1 spectra which contain
isotope structures...)
}
\details{
The function cuts off all peaks within 0.5 m/z from every peak, in
decreasing intensity order, which are below 5% of the referring peak's
intensity.  E.g. for peaks m/z=100, int=100; m/z=100.2, int=2, m/z=100.3,
int=6, m/z 150, int=10: The most intense peak (m/z=100) is selected, all
neighborhood peaks below 5% are removed (in this case, only the m/z=100.2
peak) and the next less intense peak is selected. Here this is the m/z=150
peak. All low-intensity neighborhood peaks are removed (nothing). The next
less intense peak is selected (m/z=100.3) and again neighborhood peaks are
cut away (nothing to cut here. Note that the m/z = 100.2 peak was alredy
removed.)
}
\note{
This is a very crude rule, but works remarkably well for our spectra.

# From the workflow:
\dontrun{
    # Filter out satellite peaks:
    shot <- filterPeakSatellites(shot)
    shot_satellite_n <- setdiff(row.names(shot_full), row.names(shot))
    shot_satellite <- shot_full[shot_satellite_n,]
    # shot_satellite contains the peaks which were eliminated as satellites.
