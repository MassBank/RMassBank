\usage{
findEIC(msRaw, mz, limit = NULL, rtLimit = NA, headerCache = NULL,
  floatingRecalibration = NULL, peaksCache = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{msRaw}{The mzR file handle}

\item{mz}{The mass or mass range to extract the EIC for: either a single mass
(with the range specified by \code{limit} below) or a mass range
in the form of \code{c(min, max)}.}

\item{limit}{If a single mass was given for \code{mz}: the mass window to extract.
A limit of 0.001 means that the EIC will be returned for \code{[mz - 0.001, mz + 0.001]}.}

\item{rtLimit}{If given, the retention time limits in form \code{c(rtmin, rtmax)} in seconds.}

\item{headerCache}{If present, the complete \code{mzR::header(msRaw)}. Passing
this value is useful if spectra for multiple compounds should be 
extracted from the same mzML file, since it avoids getting the data
freshly from \code{msRaw} for every compound.}

\item{floatingRecalibration}{A fitting function that \code{predict()}s a mass shift based on the retention time. Can be used
if a lockmass calibration is known (however you have to build the calibration yourself.)}

\item{peaksCache}{If present, the complete output of \code{mzR::peaks(msRaw)}. This speeds up the lookup
if multiple compounds should be searched in the same file.}
}
\value{
A \code{[rt, intensity, scan]} matrix (\code{scan} being the scan number.)
