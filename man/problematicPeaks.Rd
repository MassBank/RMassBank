\title{Identify intense peaks (in a list of unmatched peaks)}
\usage{
problematicPeaks(peaks_unmatched, peaks_matched, mode = "pH")
}
\arguments{
\item{peaks_unmatched}{Table of unmatched peaks, with at least \code{cpdID,
scan, mzFound, int}.}

\item{peaks_matched}{Table of matched peaks (used for base peak reference),
with at least \code{cpdID, scan, int}.}

\item{mode}{Processing mode (\code{"pH", "pNa"} etc.)}
}
\value{
A filtered table with the potentially problematic peaks, including
the precursor mass and MSMS base peak intensity (\code{aMax}) for reference.
}
\description{
Finds a list of peaks in spectra with a high relative intensity (>10% and
1e4, or >1% and 1e5) to write a list of peaks which must be manually
checked.  Peaks orbiting around the parent peak mass (calculated from the
compound ID), which are very likely co-isolated substances, are ignored.
