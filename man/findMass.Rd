\title{Calculate exact mass}
\usage{
findMass(cpdID_or_smiles, retrieval = "standard", mode = "pH")
}
\arguments{
\item{cpdID_or_smiles}{SMILES code or compound ID of the molecule. (Numerics
are treated as compound ID).}

\item{retrieval}{A value that determines whether the files should be handled either as "standard",
if the compoundlist is complete, "tentative", if at least a formula is present or "unknown"
if the only know thing is the m/z}

\item{mode}{\code{"pH", "pNa", "pM", "pNH4", "mH", "mM", "mFA"} for different ions 
            ([M+H]+, [M+Na]+, [M]+, [M+NH4]+, [M-H]-, [M]-, [M+FA]-).
Only needed for retrieval="unknown"}
}
\value{
Returns the exact mass of the uncharged molecule.
}
\description{
Retrieves the exact mass of the uncharged molecule. It works directly from
the SMILES and therefore is used in the MassBank workflow
(\code{\link{mbWorkflow}}) - there, all properties are calculated from the
SMILES code retrieved from the database. (Alternatively, takes also the
compound ID as parameter and looks it up.) Calculation relies on Rcdk.
