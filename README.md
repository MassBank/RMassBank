# Continuous integration

The RMassBank project master branch is subjected to CI using travis: 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MassBank/RMassBank.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MassBank/RMassBank)

# New Main Branch

We moved the default branch from `master` to `main` to get rid of this offensive term.
